My name is Jessica Muttitt. I currently live in Boston, MA and am a graduate candidate at Northeastern University. I expect to graduate in December 2016 with an MA in History with a concentration in Public History. I will be completing my fieldwork requirement for the program at the Paul Revere House in the North End.
<br />
<br />
I am hoping after graduation to work in the education department of a museum. My resume can be viewed <a href="http://jessicadmuttitt.github.io/cv.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
