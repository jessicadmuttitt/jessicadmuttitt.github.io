My name is Jessica Muttitt. I currently live in Boston, MA and am a graduate candidate at Northeastern University. I expect to graduate in December 2016 with an MA in History with a concentration in Public History. I will be completing my fieldwork requirement for the program at the Paul Revere House in the North End.
